            <p>We are a distributed, agile team. We operate in several major US cities: presently San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and Chicago. We have a network of contractors that we reach out to for highly specialized tasks.</p>
            <p>Local teams usually work with local clients, so a client in Chicago will talk to our Chicago engineers. The exception to this is if a remote member offers expertise in an area necessary to complete the task.</p>
